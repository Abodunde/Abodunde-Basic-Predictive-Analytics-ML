This repository consists of 4 folders.

Folder 1 (Deep Learning Using Back Propagation) explores the concept of back propagation (neural network) as a deep learning mechanism in machine learning. In the jupyter notebook, not much attention is giving to exploratory data analysis as the main objective was to show the implementation of a neural network from scratch.

Folder 2 (EDA and Supervised Classifiers) explores in-depth extensive exploratory analysis and data preprocessing that would be carried out on any dataset in order to prepare it adequately for modelling. Furthermore, the "Exploratory Data Analysis and Classifiers Using EasyVisa Data".ipynb file deeply explores majority of classifiers we have in machine learning such as "Decision Tree", "Bagging Classifier", "Random Forest", "Adaboost Classifier", "Gradient Boost Classifier", "XGBoost Classifier",and "Stacking Classifier". We show the implementation from scratch as well as the technique for choosing the best out of them using GridSearch.

Folder 3 (Supervised Learning) explores in-depth extensive exploratory analysis and data preprocessing that would be carried out on any dataset in order to prepare it adequately for modelling. Furthermore, the "Supervised Learning Using US Department of Energy Data".ipynb file deeply explores different models we have in machine learning such as "Logistic regression", "Bagging", "Ada Boost", "Gradient Boost", "Decision Trees" and "XG Boost Classifier". We also explore the concept of cross-validation in this file. We show the implementation from scratch as well as the technique for choosing the best out of them using GridSearch. 

Folder 4 (Unsupervised Learning), we explore in technical terms unsupervised learning. The "Unsupervised Learning Using Stock Data".ipynb file employs stock data from Trade and Ahead to explore different clustering techniques such as Heirarchical Clustering, Agglomerative Clustering, K Means, etc. A deep exploratory data anlysis is also carried out to adequately prepare the data for modelling.
